# Introduction

Dispersion is a characteristic feature of certain types of partial differential equations, and the behavior of their solution profiles can vary significantly depending on the algebraic properties of time. In particular, when considering square wave initial data and time that is a rational multiple of the period, the solution takes on a piecewise step-like form.

However, when time is an irrational multiple of the period, the solution becomes a continuous but non-differentiable fractal curve. This striking phenomenon is commonly referred to as the "Talbot Effect" and is characterized by the existence of two distinct types of solution behavior for dispersive PDEs, depending on the choice of time.

There is currently limited understanding of how the "Talbot Effect" manifests itself on $\mathbb{S}^2$. As such, our primary objective in this research is to use numerical methods to investigate the behavior of the "Talbot Effect" on the 2-Sphere.
